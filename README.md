# CS408-Assignment-3-Actual

Nichoals Kelly

Introduction
First off, I did not end up completing all parts of the assignment, I was unable to figure out a way to implement the ease in and ease out functions as well as difficulty
interpolating values to create a smooth constant motion for the object. I was however able to get smooth motion on a straight line and could get a full traversal of the curve
with the object just without constant motion.

How to run
To run my project you will have to download the contents by clicking the green code button and downloading zip file.

Once done that you will unzip that file and open your program environment and create a new C++ project. I personally use Visual Studio 2022. Once your new project is
created you will need to take the contents of the zip folder and place them in the project folder wherever that is on your computer. Make sure that everything stays in 
one folder or else it won't run. If you use visual studio 2022 you will need to go to solution explorer and add existing items, make sure to add all Header, c++, do not
add .obj files or the code will not compile. Once all is added compile and run the progam a screen will appear and a yellow ball will traverse the line in a choppy manner
in the comments above I have explained this.
